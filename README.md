2. Run the Gradio application: ` app.py`
3. Access the application interface: Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:7860`

Customization:
- To use your own dataset, replace the `Symptoms2dataset.csv` file in the `dataset/` directory.
- To fine-tune and train the model, modify the training code and update the `model_weights.pth` file in the `model/` directory.
